                    Welcome to OWASP Threat Dragon, a completely free open-source threat modelling tool from OWASP. To use Threat Dragon you have
                    two options. With <strong>option 1</strong> you don't need to sign-up or sign-in. All your models are stored on your local device, so your data is never
                    sent to anyone else or stored at some unknown location on the cloud. This works best if you are wokring on your own on a project.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    With <strong>option 2</strong> you can sign in using your GitHub account and store your models next your GitHub code repo, taking advantage
                    of their file versioning, backups and general awesomeness. This is the best option if you are working as part of a team or if you want to
                    work on your models from different devices.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Threat Dragon is currently in the early stages of development (an OWASP incubator project) so there might be some bugs and the data 
                    model might change and leave you unable load your models. If you make a model that you want to keep, you can print it to a file or hard copy.
