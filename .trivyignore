# Client-side only vulnerability according to redhat: 
#    https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3807
# This is also baked into the node:16-alpine image at this time (inside of nodejs itself)
# We will need to wait for node to update
# As a temporary mitigating factor, I've added a custom resolution for all projects
CVE-2021-3807

# ignoring these vulnerabilities in zlib,
# there are no updates to zlib and so these are unlikely to be fixed
CVE-2018-25032
CVE-2022-37434

# https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2022/cve-2022-24999/
# qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products,
# allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application
# The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3,
# and 6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has deps: qs@6.9.7 in its
# release description, is not vulnerable).
