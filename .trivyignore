# Client-side only vulnerability according to redhat: 
#    https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3807
# This is also baked into the node:16-alpine image at this time (inside of nodejs itself)
# We will need to wait for node to update
# As a temporary mitigating factor, I've added a custom resolution for all projects
CVE-2021-3807

# ignoring this vulnerability in zlib, because there is no fix and unlikely to be fixed
CVE-2018-25032
