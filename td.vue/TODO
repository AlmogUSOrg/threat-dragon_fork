- Loading indicator (WIP, see app and loader store)
- Pagination
- Deep linking (redo routing entirely, match old way?)
- refresh tokens
- Get refresh token when making API calls
- Warn when token expiring
- Logout
- Error handling for API requests that might fail (toast service?)
- Do a POC to use no back-end whatsoever (demo and test only)
- BUG: Development (webpack) proxy fails sometimes saying the backend is not reachable, not sure why.  Hopefully only a dev error
