- Update or remove the CSP violation reporter
- Add threats to diagram ui
- Add threat engine/suggested threats
- Add tests for ThreatmodelEdit view
- Add report feature
- Document architecture

- Update bootstrap dev dep to 4.6.1 or 4.7.0 when they're available (remove sass division warnings that cannot be suppressed)

BUGS:
    - No setter for contributor
    - 500 error returned from server if no threat models found
    - 404 if branch has a "/" in it, need to urlencode things before sending and ensure server understands
    - Keyboard shortcuts shows not implemented yet text
