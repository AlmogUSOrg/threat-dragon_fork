- Run smoke tests on PRs
- Empty state on list views
-- List views should probably be a separate component to handle empty state
-- Handle pagination
- Do a POC to use no back-end whatsoever (demo and test only)
- Gracefully handle an expired refresh token (TODO in httpClient)
- Add tests for ThreatmodelEdit view
- Update flow to create a new diagram
- Add report feature
- Add the download from github feature
- Error handling for API requests that might fail (toast service?)
- Add more e2e tests after the no backend work is done (hard to test since we would need loads of configuration)
- Document architecture
