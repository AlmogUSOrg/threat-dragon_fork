- Update or remove the CSP violation reporter
- Add threats to diagram ui
- Add threat engine/suggested threats
- Add tests for ThreatmodelEdit view
- Add report feature
- Document architecture
- Update docs link to reference new docs location (built in)
- Legend for diagram
- Update logging for server, very hard to read currently (consider Winston)

BUGS:
    - No setter for contributor
    - 500 error returned from server if no threat models found
    - 404 if branch has a "/" in it, need to urlencode things before sending and ensure server understands
