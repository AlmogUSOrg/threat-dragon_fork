- Empty state on list views
-- List views should probably be a separate component to handle empty state
-- Handle pagination
-- Consider alternative UI for list views, maybe something more concise?

- Do a POC to use no back-end whatsoever (demo and test only)
- Gracefully handle an expired refresh token (TODO in httpClient)

- Update or remove the CSP violation reporter

- Add tests for ThreatmodelEdit view
- Add report feature
- Add the download from github feature
- Error handling for API requests that might fail (toast service?)
- Add more e2e tests after the no backend work is done (hard to test since we would need loads of configuration)
- Document architecture
- Update docs link to reference new docs location (built in)
- Legend for diagram
- Update logging for server, very hard to read currently (consider Winston)

BUGS:
    - Ocassional bug decoding json on login using github: DOMException: String contains an invalid character
        - Seems to be in the AUTH_SET_JWT mutation
    - No setter for contributor
    - 500 error returned from server if no threat models found
    - 404 if branch has a "/" in it, need to urlencode things before sending and ensure server understands
