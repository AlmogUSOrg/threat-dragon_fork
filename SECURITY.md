## Security Policy 

If you find a vulnerability anywhere in this project, such as the source or scripts,
then please let the project admins know ASAP and we will fix it as a critical priority.

Ideally open a [security advisory][advisory] which will be provided only to Threat Dragon's admins in strict confidence.

Alternatively send an encrypted email to [Jon Gadsden][mail] to start the secure disclosure process.
